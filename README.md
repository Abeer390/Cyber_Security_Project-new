With the rapid expansion of internet-connected systems, the number and complexity of malware attacks have risen dramatically. Traditional detection methods, such as signature-based and heuristic-based techniques, struggle to keep up with emerging threats, particularly those leveraging obfuscation and polymorphism. This creates a pressing need for intelligent, automated models capable of identifying malicious patterns with greater accuracy and adaptability.

Deep learning has proven highly effective in addressing such challenges, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) standing out for their ability to extract spatial features from complex data. By focusing on static and behavioral characteristics of malware, CNNs can automatically learn intricate patterns that traditional methods often miss. This research emphasizes the development of a CNN-based malware detection system that is accurate, scalable, and capable of identifying both known and zero-day malware with high confidence. The model's focus on leveraging spatial feature extraction makes it well-suited to detect obfuscated and sophisticated threats, offering a modern solution to an ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape.
